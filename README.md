# competitor_analysis
As part of my internship with a bank in Ghana, I was tasked with two other interns to conduct a competitor analysis among the bank and a select group of other banks in Ghana. The criteria included network distribution (branches & ATMs), pricing of services, digital entrenchment (chatbot, app, internet banking, GhanaPay, MoMo), self-service and social media (X) sentiments. The script generated to fetch the branches and ATMs proved not to be very efficient and so this part of the work had to be done manually from each bank's website. Data on pricing also had to be fetched manually from the banks' websites, as well as data on digital entrenchment and self-service. A script was written in python to fetch the social media sentiments from X but due to restrictions in the use of the X API, this data also had to be fetched manually. The script however, is included in this repository in a jupyter notebook. After fetching the posts and classifying the sentiments, the results together with data from the other criteria were exported to Power BI and visualized. The attached google drive link contains all these files.
